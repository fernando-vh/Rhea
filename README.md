# Welcome to Rhea from the MMC (My Music Creator)

You are in the Rhea documentation. Rhea is our frontend server, it was created in React and everything you see here was kind of hard to implement, even if 50% of the code was copy-pasted from somewhere else.

## Project dependencies 
Apart from the package.json this was implemented on:
  * React: 6.14.8
  * Node: 12.19.0

No planned maintenance for future updates.

## Installation process

1. First you need to run the kronos server, [here](https://github.com/fernando-vh/Kronos#installation-process) is the installation guide.
2. Then run the `npm install` for all the node dependencies.
3. Now you need to configure your `.env` files (There is an `sample.env` in the project where you can see what variables you need to set).
4. Finally run the server with `npm start`.
